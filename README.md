## Features

- Zero-config: Works out of the box without the need to install any other compiler or plugins
- Supports ESNext syntax with transforming limitations (See _Note_)
- Supports `sls package`, `sls deploy` and `sls deploy function`
- Supports `sls invoke local`
- Integrates nicely with [`serverless-offline`](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)

_Note_: The default JavaScript syntax target is determined from serverless provider configuration otherwise set to [`node10`], so the final bundle will be supported by all [AWS Lambda Node.js runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html). If you still using an old lambda runtime and have to respect it you can play with esbuild `target` option, see [JavaScript syntax support](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild#javascript-syntax-support) for more details about syntax transform limitations.

## Install

```sh
yarn add --dev serverless-esbuild
# or
npm install -D serverless-esbuild
# or
pnpm install -D serverless-esbuild
```

Add the following plugin to your `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-esbuild
```

## Configure

By default, no configuration is required, but you can change esbuild behavior in custom `esbuild` section in `serverless.yaml` config:

```yml
custom:
  esbuild:
    bundle: true
    minify: false
```

Check [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild#command-line-usage) documentation for the full list of available options. Note that some options like `entryPoints` or `outdir` cannot be overwritten.
The package specified in the `exclude` option is passed to esbuild as `external`, but it is not included in the function bundle either. The default value for this option is `['aws-sdk']`. You can set `exclude` to `*` to disable packaging `node_modules`.

See [example folder](examples) for a minimal example.

### Including extra files

All files from `package/patterns` will be included in the final build file. See [Patterns](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/packaging#patterns).

Include/exclude is deprecated, but still supported.

### External Dependencies

Packages that are marked as `external` and exist in the package.json's `dependencies` will be installed and included with your build under `node_modules`. You can configure how these are installed:

```yml
custom:
  esbuild:
    packager: yarn # optional - npm, pnpm or yarn, default is npm
    packagePath: absolute/path/to/package.json # optional - by default it looks for a package.json in the working directory
    packagerOptions: # optional - packager related options, currently supports only 'scripts' for both npm, pnpm and yarn
      scripts: # scripts to be executed, can be a string or array of strings
        - echo 'Hello World!'
        - rm -rf node_modules
```

To easily mark all the `dependencies` in `package.json` as `external`, you can utilize `esbuild-node-externals` [plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild-node-externals).

To mark one or more individual packages as external, use the following configuration:

```yml
custom:
  esbuild:
    external:
      - 'my-package-name'
      - 'another-package-name'
```

### Passing Extra Arguments to Packager

This might be required to resolve some issues on package installation.
One example is to pass `--legacy-peer-deps` to npm v7+, to use legacy `peerDependency` resolution behavior.

```yml
custom:
  esbuild:
    installExtraArgs: # optional. Default is empty (no arguments)
      - "--legacy-peer-deps" 
```

### Using esbuild plugins

_Note that the plugins API is still experimental : see [the documentation page](https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/)_

You can configure esbuild plugins by passing a plugins' configuration file:

```yml
custom:
  esbuild:
    plugins: plugins.js
```

The plugins' configuration file must be a javascript file exporting an array of plugins (see `examples/individually/plugins.js` for a dummy plugin example):

```javascript
let myPlugin = {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  setup(build) {
    // plugin implementation
  },
};

// default export should be an array of plugins
module.exports = [myPlugin];
```

or a function that accepts `serverless` instance and returns an array of plugins (see [issue #168](https://github.com/floydspace/serverless-esbuild/issues/168) for an example):

```javascript
module.exports = (serverless) => {
  const myPlugin = {
    name: 'my-plugin',
    setup(build) {
      // plugin implementation with `serverless` instance access
      console.log('sls custom options', serverless.service.custom);
    },
  };

  // an array of plugins must be returned
  return [myPlugin];
};
```

### Native Zip

If you wish to use your system's `zip` executable to create archives (can be significantly faster when working with many large archives), set the `nativeZip` option:

```yml
custom:
  esbuild:
    nativeZip: true
```

**NOTE:*** This will produce non-deterministic archives which causes a Serverless deployment update on every deploy.

### Concurrency

If you wish to limit the concurrency of the bundling process (can be very expensive on memory), set the `concurrency` option:

```yml
custom:
  esbuild:
    concurrency: 10
```

**NOTE:*** This will produce slower builds.

## Usage

### Automatic compilation

The normal Serverless deploy procedure will automatically compile with `esbuild`:

- Create the Serverless project with `serverless create -t aws-nodejs`
- Install Serverless esbuild plugin as above
- Deploy with `serverless deploy`

### Usage with serverless-offline

The plugin integrates very well with [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) to
simulate AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway locally.

Add the plugins to your `serverless.yml` file and make sure that `serverless-esbuild`
precedes `serverless-offline` as the order is important:

```yaml
plugins: ...
  - serverless-esbuild
  ...
  - serverless-offline
  ...
```

Run `serverless offline` or `serverless offline start` to start the Lambda/API simulation.

In comparison to `serverless offline`, the `start` command will fire an `init` and a `end` lifecycle hook which is needed for `serverless-offline` and e.g. `serverless-dynamodb-local` to switch off resources (see below)

Automatic compilation is available while using the plugin with `serverless-offline`. Following are the default configuration:

```
pattern: './**/*.(js|ts)' # watches all javascript or typescripts files in the project
ignore: [.build, 'dist', 'node_modules', '.serverless']
```

You can override the defaults by using `watch` option in serverless esbuild config. Both options take [anymatch-compatible definition] (https://github.com/es128/anymatch)

```
custom:
  esbuild:
    watch:
      pattern: ['src/**/*.ts'] # match only typescript files in src directory
      ignore: ['temp/**/*']
```

Note: When overriding ignore pattern, remember to ignore `.build` directory to avoid endless compilation.

#### serverless-dynamodb-local

Configure your service the same as mentioned above, but additionally add the `serverless-dynamodb-local`
plugin as follows:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-esbuild
  - serverless-dynamodb-local
  - serverless-offline
```

Run `serverless offline start`.

### Run a function locally

To run your compiled functions locally you can:

```bash
$ serverless invoke local --function <function-name>
```

Options are:

- `--function` or `-f` (required) is the name of the function to run
- `--path` or `-p` (optional) path to JSON or YAML file holding input data
- `--data` or `-d` (optional) input data

## Plugin-Specific Options in Serverless Config

These options belong under `custom.esbuild` in your `serverless.yml` or `serverless.ts` file, and are specific to this plugin (these are not esbuild API options):

- `packager`: Package to use (npm, pnpm or yarn - npm is default)
- `packagePath`: Path to the `package.json` file (`./package.json` is default)
- `packagerOptions`:
  - `scripts`: A string or array of scripts to be executed, currently only supports 'scripts' for npm, pnpm and yarn
- `exclude`: An array of dependencies to exclude (declares it as an external as well as excludes it from Lambda ZIP file)
- `installExtraArgs`: Optional arguments passed to npm or yarn (empty is default)
